    "# 1. Introduction \n",
    "Every year, more than 795,000 people in the United States have a stroke. About 610,000 of these are first or new strokes. About 87% of all strokes are ischemic strokes, in which blood flow to the brain is blocked [CDC.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/facts.htm). Strokes are the No. 5 cause of death and a leading cause of disability in the United States. 80% of strokes are preventable [American Stoke Association](https://www.stroke.org/en/about-stroke). From 1990 to 2019, the change in the prevalence of stroke in the general population increased by about 60%. [newsroom.heart.org](https://newsroom.heart.org/news/u-s-stroke-rate-declining-in-adults-75-and-older-yet-rising-in-adults-49-and-younger)\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1a. Objectives\n",
    "Because of the nature of this problem, and in order to capture as many potential stroke victims as possible, I feel it is appropriate to be very aggressive with stroke predictions. For this reason I have chosen Recall as the evaluation metric for my models. This will inevitably lead to extra false positives, however, because of the health risks associated with strokes, I feel the measures needed to declare an individual to NOT be at risk, outweigh a misclassification of at risk.\n",

Technically these features are categorical, with 1 and 0 representing \"Yes\" and \"No,\" so it is not surprising the pairplot does not reveal much about these features given they are masquerading around under the ruse of numeric values. On that same note, it is important to note, the pairplot excludes categorical features altogether. Notice `gender`, `ever_married`, `work_type`, `Residence_type`, and `smoking_status` are absent. These features will need to be explored seperately. But first, based on short comings of the pair plot, I would like to add a feature to better understanding the relationship between hypertension and heart_disease; I will call this new feature `hyper_heart`. Secondly, based on the insight of the pairplot, I want to add a feature that seperates out patients who are 50 and up. Next, I will break down `bmi` and `avg_glucose_level` into categorical ranges as this is more conducive to machine learning. \n"

    "Using forloop to run baselines, scaled and non scaled (StandardScaler when scaled), smote and non smote (SMOTENC or SMOTEN depending on weather or not data is all categorical or not) and putting results in a `results` data frame. Some form of imputation is required due to NaNs in `bmi` or `bmi_ranges` so the loop runs through 3 different ways of imputing data (IterativeImputer, SimpleImputer, KNNImputer). Scaling and class imbalance techniques are optional so both have a None added to their list.  Note from step 8a, these models have no parameters yet other than setting a `random_state` (except in KNeighborsClassifier which does not have a `random_state` param)."
